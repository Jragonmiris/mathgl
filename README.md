This repository is no longer maintained. It has been included in the go-gl project and the new repository is kept here:

https://github.com/go-gl/mathgl

This repository is maintained because the new one has a sweeping API change. I will still process bug reports on this repository, but otherwise no development or features will be added.

MathGL
======

A code-generated 3D math library for the Go language.
